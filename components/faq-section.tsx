    question: "How does the voice-based interview simulation work?",
    answer:

    question: "What kind of feedback will I receive?",
    answer:
      "You'll get detailed, personalized feedback on your speech delivery (filler words, pace, pauses, clarity) and content relevance. Our AI identifies specific areas for improvement and provides targeted suggestions to help you sound more confident and articulate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I practice for specific companies or roles?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We curate company and role-specific question banks so you can practice with questions relevant to your target positions. Whether you're preparing for a tech interview, consulting case, or behavioral round, we've got you covered.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my practice data private and secure?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Your interview recordings and practice sessions are private and encrypted. We take data security seriously and never share your information with third parties.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer:
      "Simply sign up, select the company and role you're preparing for, and start your first practice session. You'll receive immediate feedback after each interview to track your progress and improve continuously.",
